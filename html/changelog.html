				<li class="rscadd">Brain damage has been completely reworked! remove: Brain damage now no longer simply makes you dumb. Although most of its effects have been shifted into a brain trauma.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Every time you take brain damage, there's a chance you'll suffer a brain trauma. There are many variations of brain traumas, split in mild, severe, and special.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mild brain traumas are the easiest to get, can be lightly to moderately annoying, and can be cured with mannitol and time.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Severe brain traumas are much rarer and require extensive brain damage before you have a chance to get them; they are usually very debilitating. Unlike mild traumas, they require surgery to cure. A new surgery procedure has been added for this, the aptly named Brain Surgery. It can also heal minor traumas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Special brain traumas are rarely gained in place of Severe traumas: they are either complex or beneficial. However, they are also even easier to cure than mild traumas, which means that keeping these will usually mean keeping a mild trauma along with it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mobs can only naturally have one mild trauma and one severe or special trauma.</li>
				<li class="balance">Brain damage will now kill and ruin the brain if it goes above 200. If it somehow goes above 400, the brain will melt and be destroyed completely.</li>
				<li class="balance">Many brain-damaging effects have been given a damage cap, making them non-lethal.</li>

Preparing spells without a rune will cost a significant amount of blood. Every talisman has been rebalanced for its spell form. With a few exceptions, blood magic exists as a "touch" spell that is very similar in behavior/appearance to the wizard touch spells.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New UI system for cultists.</li>

The user has a unique appearance while ghosted and manifested cult ghosts can see ghosts as well - allowing their summoner to lead them from the spirit realm.</li>

Effect includes a massive EMP, unique hallucination for non-cultists, and if the cult is doing poorly, certain events. The rune can only occur in the Nar-Sie ritual sites and will prevent Nar-Sie from being summoned there in the future.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">No more EMP rune.</li>
				<li class="balance">The conceal/reveal spell now has 10 charges and will conceal far more, including cult structures and flooring.</li>
				<li class="balance">The stun spell will now stun for ~4 less seconds and silence for 2 more seconds.</li>
				<li class="balance">The EMP spell now costs 10 health to use, up from 5, and has had its heavy/light EMP range nerfed by 1 and 2 respectively (now 3 and 6).</li>
				<li class="balance">The shackles spell now has a silence effect similar to the stun talisman.</li>
				<li class="balance">The hallucination spell now has multiple charges.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The teleport spell can now be used on other adjacent cultists.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Summon Tome and Summon Armor have been combined into "Summon Equipment", which lets you choose between summoning a Ritual Dagger or Combat Gear (same loadout that Summon Armor used to provide).</li>
				<li class="balance">Standard cult robes now have -10 melee and -10 laser armor.</li>
				<li class="balance">The "Construction" spell will now convert airlocks into cult airlocks and cyborgs (after ~10 seconds) into constructs. The airlock is the most fragile in the game, with reduced integrity, armor, and render it vulnerable to most attacks. Cyborg "reconstruction" will be accompanied by an obvious effect/sound.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood Rites. This spell allows you to absorb blood from your surroundings or adjacent non-cultists. You can use the blood rites as a convenient heal (self-healing is significantly more costly though) or you can try to gather large quantities of blood for unique and powerful relics.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood spear, a fragile but robust spear with a special recall ability</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood bolts, the cultist's version of arcane barrage. The bolts will infuse cultists with unholy water and damage anything else.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood beam, the ultimate blood rite. After a channeling period it will fire 12 powerful beams across a long distance, piercing almost any surface (except blessed turf), and damaging all non-cult life caught in the beam.</li>

				<li class="balance">Pylons will now heal constructs faster and restore slightly more blood than before.</li>
				<li class="balance">Cult floors are now highly resistant to atmospheric changes.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Unholy water will now splash victims properly.</li>
				<li class="balance">Unholy Water Vials created at altars now contains 50 units, and is better at healing brute, and deals slightly more damage to non-cultists, the splash ratio was reduced to 20% to compensate for the increased volume and damage.</li>
				<li class="balance">Holy water will purge any and all blood spells from cultists.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Artificers, Wraiths and Juggernauts can now scribe revive, teleport, and barrier runes respectively with a 3 minute cooldown.</li>
				<li class="balance">Juggernauts' forcewall is now 3x1 but it has a ~30% longer cooldown. Juggernauts got a modest speed increase (2.5 from 3) but lost a modest amount of HP (200 from 250).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Juggernauts now get a ranged attack "Gauntlet Echo", a single projectile that moves about as fast as them and does 30 damage with 5 seconds of stun and a 35s cooldown.</li>
				<li class="balance">The number of ghosts summonable by the manifest spirit rune is 3, down from 5.</li>
				<li class="balance">It now takes ~20% less water (~25 units) and ~30 seconds less to deconvert cultists via holy water.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The emagged library console will now distribute ritual daggers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Using the dagger on a rune will now take a 1-second channel to destroy it, to avoid incidents where people instantly wipe a critical rune by accident.</li>
				<li class="balance">Standard runed airlocks now have a lower damage deflection so they can be destroyed with most respectable melee weapons (10+).</li>
				<li class="balance">Teleporter runes that are used from space or lavaland will result in the destination rune giving off a unique effect for 60 seconds. This effect includes a long distance (but not obvious antagonistic) sound, a bright lighting effect, and a visual cue that will indicate where the cultist arrived from.</li>
